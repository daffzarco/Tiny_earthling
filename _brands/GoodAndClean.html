    I find that as I’m getting older, I’m not trying to hide my skin, maybe that’s because I’m getting lazier with age or better yet just plain happy with what my mama gave me — #thanksma. Those extra 20 minutes to put on makeup is better spent in bed or drinking tea and writing my morning gratitude. Skincare has become a major player in my day to day and when you find great products, that is certified organic and affordable, I want to shout it out and tell everyone! So let me shout it out — GOOD & CLEAN!
  </p>
  <p>
    Good & Clean is 100% natural and cruelty free skincare. Based in balmy Brisbane, these products have been meticulously well thought off from scent to packaging. It’s no ordinary skincare brand! Yes, it has great brand aesthetics and products, it’s all of those and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a brand that gives back to protect and save marine turtles and help protect and restore iconic Australian ecosystems - the Great Barrier Reef and Daintree Forest. For every purchase you get to choose which conservation gets your 10%. You can choose a different one for very purchase you make if it’s too hard to choose just one, you’ll fall in love with more than a few of their items. There’s so much to love about this brand and helping a trio of wonderful conservation projects are great purchases indeed!

    <strong>Products I fell in love with:</strong>
  </div>
  <strong>Cream Cleanser</strong>
  <p>
    I would describe my skin type as normal but oily on the T zones but wait for it… dry and sensitive in winter. Gotta love our skin! Having changed over to this cleanser in the beginning of winter when my skin was fighting with me, Good & Clean’s cream cleanser was a dream, it didn’t irritate and was cooling on my cheeks where it’s most sensitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ingredient list features: Aloe Vera, Calendula flower extract and Sweet almond oil.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first time I used it, I didn’t want to rinse it off because of the amazing Aloe Vera Scent, it just smells heavenly transporting you to a dense forest and the texture is soft on the skin. The cleanser is also a great makeup remover, which really surprised me but definitely tickled my traveler heart strings, a product that can work magic on 2 levels is gold for any traveler.
  </p>
  <strong>Coconut Lime Scrub</strong>
  <p>
    I’ve never been a big user of scrubs, I know there are amazing benefits from using it and it wasn’t until I tried this scrub that I vowed to keep it as part of my shower menu. For a few scrub newbies (like me), a scrub works in a few wonderful ways - the granules help to remove dead skin cells, leaving the skin smooth and allowing post-wash moisturizer to work better, the massaging motion helps improve circulation and… it’s also a great stress reliever.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ingredient list features: Coconut oil, Citrus oil and Green tea leaf.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love the zesty citrus smell of this scrub and the coconut oil leaves my skin feeling nourished.
    I think we tend to put a lot more emphasis on skincare for our face and tend to forget about the rest of our body. A good scrub used 1-2 times a week can really help boost circulation and give the skin cells a nudge and help the process in revealing new healthy skin.
  </p>
  <strong>Lip Balm</strong>
  <p>
    Good & Clean’s Lip Balm is hands down one of my favorite products. It is one of the best lip balms I’ve used. One of my lip balm hates is sticky dense formulas — I concur this is not one of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ingredient list features: Cacao butter, Shea butter, Castor oil and Candelia wax.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a staple handbag product and is my go to savior for saving my lips against climate woes. Cacao butter and Shea butter hydrate and moisture while Castor oil and Candela wax protect and lock in the moisture. Definitely my saving grace this winter!
