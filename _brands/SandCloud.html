    When summer rolls around in Sydney, everyone is heading straight to the beaches to enjoy the sun and salty sea. I live a few minutes away from the beach and no matter what season it's always been a place of serenity and clarity for me. But, what if we didn't have the ocean? Can you imagine? The ocean makes up 71% of our planet's surface. I don't want to imagine a planet without the ocean. We would be losing a very big part of our planet. It's hard to say but the oceans and marine life are being heavily affected by waste and global warming.
    So what if you could purchase beach essentials and give back to marine convservation projects.

    Let me introduce to these guys - Sand Cloud Towels. They are a sustainable and eco-friendly brand based in Los Angeles, doing their part to protect the oceans and marine life. Their speciaility are towels, in beautiful colourfyl designs and they've dabbled in a few other accessories too. It's become synonimous as a brand that not only sells towels but awareness for saving the oceans.
