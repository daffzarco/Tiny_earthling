I am a big believer in gratitude and the power and magic that it brings into your life. When you say ‘thank you’ for something in your life, you get a nice little feeling in your body. Imagine if you had gratitude for everything in your life, this feeling would fill your whole entire body and shoot out into the universe and attract more magic back to you.&nbsp;

I’m going be start a series Be Magical and write a post once a fortnight on magic practices you can focus on to get the magic flowing in your everyday life. I believe that for us to see the true beauty of our planet and be active in making changes we need to start with us and see that we are magical. So let’s begin.&nbsp;

Let’s begin with a really short Magic practice. Read through the complete Practice, then try it out in your own time.&nbsp;

&nbsp;All you need are 3 things:&nbsp;

* A pen&nbsp;
* Paper (you can get yourself a small little gratitude journal)
* Quiet space&nbsp;

**Do your Magic**

When you’re ready, find a comfortable spot to sit. I like sitting cross legged on the ground, but fluff up some pillows for you back or pull a blanket over your legs, if that makes you comfortable. Make it your own!&nbsp;

***Breath & Pulse***

Take 3 deep breaths and place your fingers at your pulse. Breath deeply in and out of your nose. This is a simple reminder that we are living organisms and our heart is the centre of our being. When you listen to your heart beat, you realize that your body is an incredible machine.

Your first gratitude and magic. Say ‘Thank you for my heart and body!’

***3 Thank You’s***

Next, with your pen and paper, write down 3 things you are grateful for today and why.&nbsp;

It doesn’t have to be grandeur, it can be as simple as ‘thank you for my tea this morning because it helped me relax and it was super yummy’ or ‘thank you for running water and a hot shower that made me squeaky clean’.&nbsp;

Start small….

Once you’ve written your three thank you’s, read over them in your mind or out loud, thinking of these thank you’s and feeling the gratitude in your body and mind.&nbsp;

***Yesterday’s Magic***

Last but not least --

Write down one big thank you from your previous day, a highlight of your day that you are grateful for .. ‘thank you for the free coffee I received from a co-worker’, ‘thank you for the great weather’

Bringing the magic full circle. How do you feel? Do you feel happier? I always feel instantly happier after doing my magic. How can you not be happy when you’re grateful for life.&nbsp;

If you continue on this series with me with each and every practice, you'll find that it’ll be easier to find things to be grateful for. You can do this at any time of the day, I normally tend to do mine on the bus to work, even though it’s not quite but that comes with practice. Just to get you started, I recommend doing this practice in a quiet space preferably at the beginning of your day, then when you’ve got the flow, you can do this anywhere, anytime — that’s the real beauty of it.

There are going to be days when you wake up and you’re not feeling well emotionally, mentally or physically and it can be hard to find the magic. In all honestly when I have days like this I really get back down to my basics especially my breath and pulse -&nbsp; to not overwhelm my mental or emotional state my gratitude is super basic and normally relates to whatever visuals I have or material objects that are near me that are mine and that I’m grateful for.&nbsp;

The Magic By Rhonda Byrne has been my magic guide in realizing the power of gratitude. If you’re interested in fast forwarding your magic, you should definitely grab a copy of this book.&nbsp;

Otherwise, tune into my Be Magical Series -These are magical practices that I’ve modified in my time of doing the magic that works for me and here I’m sharing it with you.

If you’ve loved this, share it with your friends and family and get the magic flowing!&nbsp;
