<h2>Why I love Bali</h2>
<p>Bali is a multifaceted island, that ticks all the right boxes for travelers. There are pockets of little subcultures like the relaxed surf town, easy going Canggu; party-night life, shopping Seminyak; health juice and self recovery, yoga Ubud and less explored areas in every direction of the island accessible by scooter. There is beauty, life and laughter found in every corner of natural wonder and beaming smiling faces of the locals.</p>
