    Let’s face it, Vegans get a bad rep for being obnoxious, aggressive people who try to force everyone to eat delicious salad. Truth be told, we’re just very passionate people, trying to give a voice to those who have none. Sometimes we get a tad sassy!

    My conscious journey started about 2 years ago, after I left for my first big solo world adventure in 2014. Like most kids, I hated vegetables and had to be forced to eat their veggies or the boogie man would come and get me at night. It worked every time! Fast forward 20-few years and I’ll happily eat broccoli raw while watching my favourite tv show. I wasn’t opposed to the idea of not eating meat but I grew up in a meat-saturated culture in the isles of the Philippines and just went along with what I thought was normal and what I was accustomed to eating.

        The first stop on my global tour, New York, totally blew my mind; in a good way and bad. THE GOOD. The bad, like walking past eateries and seeing large portions of meat and grease on plates devoured by millions of people in the city…which made me feel super sick. I didn’t know what the feeling in my stomach was, I just knew I wasn’t happy about what I was seeing. That's when I was introduced to Cowspiracy and my next to nothing knowledge about animal agriculture was bombarded with information that was truly eye opening and compelling. Watching Earthling a few months after cemented my decision to take on a plant based food life!

    From then on I started making steps to cutting down my meat consumption. I was lucky in the sense that I was only really giving up chicken, seafood and eggs. I didn’t like milk and I never had a big love for cheese or red meat. Over a few months I had gone completely vegan and that’s not to say I always walked the straight line and theres no vegan out there who can say they haven’t mistakenly eaten egg in something or grabbed a cheeky twix while the ladies came to visit monthly (mucho guilty). Money, travel and time constraints also play a big role in our daily choices for good, its not always perfect.

    For me it comes down to three things:

    Our beautiful animal friends live a good life and animal species don’t go extinct
    Preserving and rejuvenating our green Earth
    Health pros galore

    Hitting my one year mark, my body felt different in the most positive way. I became more aware of my everyday life, my purchases and my actions for e.g.. wearing leather, plastic consumption, cruelty free beauty.  Overall I felt like a kinder human. Right here, right now… two years later I have no regrets, I’m still learning so many things and taking baby steps to changing other aspects of my life that could be more planet friendly.

    My way of inspiring people is living by example. I bring meals to work or grab a meal from a store and there’s always a conversation with someone about what I’m eating, how I shop and it just rolls on from there. People get curious and may start taking little steps, just from knowing that it is possible. They met a vegan person, who wasn’t starving from lack of protein. Can I get a hell yeh!!

    Vegans come in all shapes and sizes, we come from different backgrounds and sexualites. We are everyday people who choose to give a voice to animals and be kinder to mother earth. We all start for different reasons, some of us pick up veganism for health reasons and a majority choose veganism for the love of our animal friends. Veganism is not a cult or a religion it’s a choice.

    As someone who loves to travel, I believe my conscious decision to be vegan, to choose ethical and sustainable where possible all help to nurture and preserve our beautiful bountiful Mother Earth. I choose to live on the planet we have!
