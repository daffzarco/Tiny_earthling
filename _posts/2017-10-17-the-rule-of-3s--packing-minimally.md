So you’re going on your next adventure. Time to pack! At this point, you’re either super relaxed because you’ve got this in the bag (literally) or you’re having a mini panic attack because ‘packing woes and stress’.

‘Whats the weather going to be like’, ‘take extra options’, are only 2 of a billion thoughts running through your head. Let me stop you right there! Do you really need 10 dresses? 10 shorts? You’re agreeing and disagreeing at the same time….. yes! Read on my friend and I’ll show you how you can pack to get the most out of your adventures.

**Packing minimal has many advantages:**

* Cheaper flights when traveling with only carry on

* It gets your creative juices going, when you have to think about the many different ways to outfit what you have&nbsp;

* Also, people tend to forget this, washing machines are universal and normally inexpensive in most countries

**But most importantly:**

***You spend less time in the morning figuring out what to wear and getting yourself out that door exploring.***

The rule of 3 can be defined as choosing the best in 3’s. Simple right! 3 is a very powerful number - the holy trinity, rule of 3 in photography, it’s all around us and being used all the time. So without waffling on about religion and math, let get packing.

So the first step to packing is cruel and hard - some of you may not like this. Don’t look at items that you haven't worn in the last 6 months for the seasons you’re packing for. The reason why I say this, is that we tend to have an inclination to think ‘oh i haven't worn this in a while, maybe i’ll wear this’. The answer is no! If you didn’t wear it then, you’re not going to wear it now. You’ll notice that we always go back to the same items that we love and feel most comfortable in and that’s also what you should be taking with you.

Let’s pack in categories and apply the rule of 3. A big travel consideration is the season/weather of your destination.

* Bottoms&nbsp;

* Tops

* Dresses / Fancy Stuff&nbsp;

* Outerwear (if you’re in summer, I normally pack just 1 lightweight jacket) \*for winter you can pack 1 heavy and 2 light)

* Shoes (i honestly only ever 2 pairs of shoes! plus thongs for showers if you’re staying in hostels so yes 3)

* Bonus \*when all is done - and if you have room (which you should if you follow this) then you have the option to pick BONUSES! hoorraaahhh!

So go through the categories and pick three items. 3 bottoms, 3 tops, 3 dresses etc. Are you happy with your choices? Now, lets do a pseudo pack and check how you’re looking with space. If you still have space at this point - This is your time for Bonuses! Again, do the rule of 3. Pick 3 items - it can be across categories or if you feel you need more in one than pick for that particular item.

At this point, you should still have some room for overseas souvenirs and shopping if you like. Especially if this is a summer pack.

**Packing for winter:**

To cut down on packing space in winter, look to pack thermals. They’re great layering pieces and will definitely keep you warm.

You can take this packing rule in so many different ways. My take is pack 3 in categories then 3 in bonuses. Seems like not a lot and thats the point. Sure, you tend to wear the same thing a lot, but thats totally fine. A high rotating wardrobe is powerful and you gain more time exploring your new city. You’ll realize that once you try to travel minimally a few times, you have a different appreciation for the way you dress while you travel and the many other things you gain.

**Sustainable Tips:**

Don’t want your clothes anymore or want to buy new clothes to replace? Donate in the country your are traveling in, or if you’re staying in hostels, there is always a new friend / nomad you’ve met who would love to repurpose and treasure your used goods. I’m not shy to hand me downs.
