whylove: Living a kind and conscious lifestyle feels good for the soul. Knowing that my actions are positively impacting the planet and people around me. It feels good to fill out my social responsibility and live with awareness towards a greater interest and well being for the society. I love taking ownership for my choices, how I spend my money, what I support and how I can consciously make a difference.
