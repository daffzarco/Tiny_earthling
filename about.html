<!-- Conclusion and The Magic  -->
  <section class="center content-listing-section">
    <div class="quote no-border">
      I believe in magic. </br> The magic resides in our soul and the powerful pure words 'thank you' is the key to unlocking the gifts of the universe.
    </div>

      I am a big believer in the practice of gratitude. Gratitude holds a very strong power to bring magic in our life. The magic of life is real guys! You see all these cliche quotes about 'you attract what you put out' or 'whatever comes around goes around', they all have their truths. When you have gratitude for anything in your life, you are attracting positive energy and magic back to you. There is an invisible realm, weaving all your experiences together and magic works in this realm. Yes, life is never balanced, there are many variables that we can't control but we can control how we react, respond and take away little wins in our life through gratitude. When we have gratitude for even the simplest things, we start being more aware of our environment and it links us straight back to nature. To see the magic in the world, it begins with you. You are magical! Yes, you!
